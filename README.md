# simple-microservice-app
This a very basic microservice app that made for learning the basics of microservices  

There are some docker files and kuternetes configuration 
If you clone this file make sure you have all the resources that needed to run the docker and kubernetes
The updation and deployments of the pods are automated by skaffold 
So make sure that you have skaffold too
